Little backstory: I like SpeedCrunch a lot! But with the Finnish matriculation exams moving to a browser-based environment, it will no longer be available! I started this project for fun to try creating a replacement for SpeedCrunch suitable for use in [Abitti 2](https://abitti.net/abitti-2-apps.html). I might submit it to YTL/Digabi if they can't find a suitable replacement for SpeedCrunch, as I don't like the calculator selection it currently has.

## Features

- Familiar terminal style
- Experimental LaTeX pasting support
- Support for user defined variables and functions
- Vast selection of built-in functions
- History (up and down arrow)
- Progressive Web App for offline usage
- Super fast math evaluation powered by [GMP and WASM](https://github.com/Daninet/gmp-wasm)
- Tokeniser based math parser (forked from Abicus)

## Usage

You can do these with your *favorite package manager*. I like [Bun](https://bun.sh), but it isn't required to run this.

1. `bun install`
2. `bun run dev`

Tada! You have a dev server running on :5173. Consult package.json 'scripts' for more information.

The project uses [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for linting and code formatting. Make sure to `bun run check` your code before submitting a PR. We use `husky` for pre-commit checks.

## TODO

- Autocorrect / suggestions
- Unit conversion
- Make the LaTeX support more stable
- Check the AI-generated Swedish translation
- Add bouncing(?) and some sort of job queue -> same expression (for suggestion and calc) could wait for the original one
